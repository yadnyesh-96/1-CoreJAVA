## ðŸ‘‹ About This Repository
I started this repo when I began my Java learning journey, and I **regularly update it with exercises, revisions, and projects**. The goal is to build a solid understanding of Java fundamentals, object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms, while keeping my practice organized and accessible.
