/*
Q46. Write a Java program to find all Abundant numbers up to n.
 An Abundant number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself.
 Example: 12 is abundant because its proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 â†’ sum = 16 > 12.
Explanation:
 Use nested loops: outer for numbers from 1 to n; inner for finding proper divisors and summing them.
 Compare sum with the number.
