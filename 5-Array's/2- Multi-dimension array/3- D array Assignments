Q2. WAP to create create matrix of 3 x 3 and sort the column data  and display it

Q3.WAP to create matrix of 3 x 3 and transpose it means convert row to column and column to row

Q4. WAP to create two matrix of 3 x 3 and perform matrix multiple on two matrix and store its result in 3rd matrix

Q5. WAP to create 3 x 3 matrix and find the second max from every column.

Q6. Write a Java program to print the elements of a given n × n matrix in spiral order, and then print the same matrix in reverse spiral order.
Example:
	Input:
1  2  3
4  5  6
7  8  9

Output Spiral: 1 2 3 6 9 8 7 4 5  
Output Reverse Spiral: 5 4 7 8 9 6 3 2 1


Q7. Rotate a given n × n matrix 90 degrees clockwise without using an extra matrix.
 Additionally, write logic to rotate each concentric square layer separately.
Example:
	Input:
1  2  3
4  5  6
7  8  9

90° Rotation:
7 4 1
8 5 2
9 6 3

Q8. Given an n × n matrix (with positive and negative integers), find the sub-matrix with the maximum sum and print the sum along with coordinates of the sub-matrix.

Example:

Input:
 1  -2  -1   4
-8   3   4   2
 3   8  10  -8
-4  -1   1   7

Output: Maximum Sum = 27
Coordinates: (1,1) to (2,2)

Q9. Write a Java program to traverse a given N x N 2D array in spiral order, but only print elements that are prime numbers.
Example:
Input:  
4x4 matrix  
1  2  3  4  
5  6  7  8  
9 10 11 12  
13 14 15 16  
Output:  
2 3 7 11 13

Q10. Write a Java program to input a 2D array (matrix) and calculate the sum of each row and the sum of each column, then display the results.
